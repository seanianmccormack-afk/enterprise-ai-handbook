The Enterprise AI Handbook
What actually works, what doesn't, and how to tell the difference.
Most enterprise AI pilots fail. The corporate response has been to rename them. This handbook exists because practitioners and decision-makers deserve a framework grounded in research, not vendor pitches.
It is free, it will stay free, and it gets better when practitioners contribute.
What's In It
Twelve standalone sections covering the full arc from reality check to long-term institutional capacity:

Who this is for
The reality check — what the data actually says
Where to aim — start with extractive gains that make work better, earn trust, then find compounding opportunities
The model is not the product — architecture matters more than the model
The data bottleneck — and why you start with a sandbox
Shadow AI — your cheapest discovery mechanism
Verification math — the concept that kills bad proposals
Know what you're buying — consulting conflicts and translation layer risk
Go/no-go decision framework
Phased deployment — readiness → pilot → production → scale
Measuring real value — ROI and Return on Employee
The long view — building institutional capacity across successive AI waves

Who It's For
People deploying AI inside companies. People deciding whether to fund, approve, or kill AI proposals. Anyone who has heard the sales pitch and needs a framework for evaluating whether it matches reality.
